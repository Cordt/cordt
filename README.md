### Hi there 👋, I'm Cordt, a Technical Product Manager from Germany

I am passionate about leveraging technology to build products that solve real customer problems, create business value and are delightful to use.
At heart, I am still a developer, spending much of my free time on functional Swift.

- 🚧 Building [Lentil](https://github.com/Cordt/Lentil), a native iOS Client for Lens Protocol
- 🌱 Learning functional Swift at [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co)
- 🗺 Love traveling the world with my wife, writing about it on [Isle of Nomads](https://isleofnomads.com)
